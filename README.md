Objectives:
1. Classify if healthy or not
2. If not, figure out which disease
3. Rare classes -> unbalanced dataset
4. Angle, light, shade, age -> data augmentation/ pre-processing
5. Additional features -> extra features to detect


To-do:
1. Successfully classify between healthy or not i.e. look for higher accuracy
2. Take step 2 results and build model for detecting which disease -> higher accuracy the better


Quick initial observation: 
1. If healthy, scab=0, rust=0, multiple diseases=0
